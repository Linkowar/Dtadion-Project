echo In D&D, you have a die called a "D20." If you would like to do anything, you have to roll the D20. If you say quickly, something bad happens. Running is permitted, but the word "quickly" just brings catastrophy. If you roll a 10 or anything under, you don't succede at that roll. If you roll a 20, the roll is perfect, and it is known as a "Crit" or a "Critical roll." Whatever you are trying to do you have just succeded at perfectly for that one roll.
